# Hi there! 🙋‍♂️ I'm André

As a Software Test Engineer at Bosch Hungary, I am passionate about Embedded Systems, Testing Techniques, Control Panel Design, Industrial Automation, Control Systems, and the Internet of Things. My expertise lies in Application Engineering and manual software testing for embedded systems, as well as control panel design.

## 💻 My Current Projects
I am currently diving into the world of C, C++, and Java for Embedded Systems and Testing, as well as Python for future AI projects. My previous work experience includes software testing for automotive systems and Industrial Refrigeration, HVAC, and Energy Saving Electrical Panel Design and Automation. I also have experience in designing and implementing SCADA systems, as demonstrated in my Bsc thesis which involved using front-end programming languages (PHP) and Codesys PLC languages to control and monitor a house heating system and an industrial-grade water tank.

## 🏆 My Goals
My goal is to become a multi-faceted, versatile professional who is always up-to-date with the latest technologies. I strive to continuously expand my knowledge and skills, and find new ways to apply them to my work.

## 🚴‍♂️ When I'm Not Working
When I'm not working, I enjoy keeping active through cycling, swimming, and traveling. I also love to relax and catch up on my favorite TV shows.

Feel free to connect with me and let's chat about anything from code to hobbies! 💬
