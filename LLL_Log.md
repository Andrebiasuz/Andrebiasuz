## March 27, 2023 - 2h session

### Topic: Organize training structure

### Goals:
- To have a template training structure for the next 6 months
- Organize thoughts in writing to better grasp my professional needs
### Learning activities:
- Wrote in a spreadsheet key topics for improvement in actual company and beyond
- Indentified TDD in Embedded Systems as a key tool for both improving in Embedded Programming and Testing Techniques
  - Read Preface and Chapter 1 of TDD on ES 
### Key Takeaways:
- Studies of 10h/w with 70% short-term goals and 30% long-term goals
- Always good to write down goals, priorities and resources to achieve it
- About TDD on Embedded:
  - Time saving and organizing tool for saving time and build Agile techniques closer to the programming techniques (build short, test short, repeat and interate)
  - Makes code reliable and brings satisfaction to write snippets of codes and see test passing. Makes refactoring easier. 
  
### Next Steps:
  - Continue reading of Chapter 2
  - Introduce new Learning topic tomorrow (ISTQB)


## March 28, 2023 - 100 min session

### Topic: Organize training structure

### Goals:
- Read ISTQB Sylabus Chapter 2
### Learning activities:
Software Development Lifecycle Models
Software Development and Software Testing
Software Development Lifecycle Models in Context
Test Levels
  Component Testing
  Integration Testing
  System Testing
  Acceptance Testing

### Key Takeaways:
  - Every SDLC is suitable for a feature or different test object. 
  - Software testing must be a part of the early stages of SW Dev, to reduce time to market and operational and development costs, as well as product operational confidence
  - Component testing is basic unit or modular testing. TDD is key here. 
  - Integration Testing is the integration between components and it is an integral part of CI , or Continuous Integration, with every component being heavily test automated. 
  - System testing is usually done by tests with business requirements in hands, and evaluates the behavior of a system as a whole, in an input to output fashion. System integration testing is crucial. 
  - Acceptance testing usually sits on the high Test Levels and basically involves the interaction between users and stakeholders to check business requirements and protection against disasters. A failure in the acceptance testing is a huge project risk, hence that importance of the tests in the lower levels. 
### Next Steps:
  - Finalize chapter 2 of ISTQB Sillabus, 
  - Take Sample Exam to assert knowledge.
